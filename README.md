## Lesson Objectives

At the end of the lesson, learners shall be able to:

* Identify and resolve **outliers and anomalies** within a dataset by applying statistical or machine learning detection methods to ensure data integrity.

* Employ **dimensionality reduction** techniques to condense high-dimensional data into optimized feature sets while preserving essential variance.

* Execute **clustering algorithms** to segment data points into distinct, homogeneous groups based on shared characteristics.
